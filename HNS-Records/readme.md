# Human Name System (HNS) Records

The Human Name System (HNS) aims to provide a distributed and secure way to map human-readable names to unique digital identities, similar to how DNS (Domain Name System) maps domain names to IP addresses. Below are the proposed record types that HNS might need, modeled similarly to DNS records but adapted for human identity management.

## Record Types

### 1. A (Address) Record
- **Purpose**: Maps a human-readable name (e.g., `stephen.hns`) to a unique identifier, such as a blockchain address, UUID, or unique digital ID.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns A 0x12345abcde789` (where `0x12345abcde789` is a unique identifier such as a blockchain address or digital fingerprint).
- **Use Cases**: Helps applications or services identify individuals uniquely across platforms.

### 2. P (Profile) Record
- **Purpose**: Contains metadata about an individual, such as their profile information—full name, contact information, public bio, or other relevant details.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns P {"name": "Stephen Ward", "email": "stephen@example.com", "publicBio": "IT Professional"}`.
- **Use Cases**: To quickly get human-readable metadata for a person in various applications, like social networks or collaborative tools.

### 3. CNAME (Canonical Name) Record
- **Purpose**: Works like a DNS CNAME—used to create aliases for names. For example, mapping multiple aliases or nicknames to a primary identity.
- **Example**: `steve.hns CNAME stephen.hns`.
- **Use Cases**: If someone has multiple names or aliases, all of which should map back to the same primary HNS name, this record type allows for flexible resolution of identity.

### 4. MX (Message Exchange) Record
- **Purpose**: Similar to a DNS MX record, but in HNS it could indicate where to route secure messages for a given user.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns MX mail.example.com`.
- **Use Cases**: Indicates preferred messaging servers or endpoints for someone, possibly supporting decentralized messaging networks (e.g., Matrix or other secure messaging systems).

### 5. E (Encryption Key) Record
- **Purpose**: Associates an HNS name with an encryption key (public key), which can be used for secure communication.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns E ssh-rsa AAAAB3...`.
- **Use Cases**: Essential for encrypted messaging or secure verification of identity in transactions—useful in contexts like encrypted email or blockchain interactions.

### 6. VC (Verifiable Credential) Record
- **Purpose**: Stores references to Verifiable Credentials (VCs), which provide additional information verified by third parties, like employment status, education, or certifications.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns VC {"issuer": "university.edu", "credential": "Bachelor's in Computer Science"}`.
- **Use Cases**: Allows third parties to verify specific information about the user, such as job title or educational qualifications.

### 7. LNK (Link) Record
- **Purpose**: A general-purpose record to provide links to external resources that are associated with the HNS entry.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns LNK {"linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/stephen-ward"}`.
- **Use Cases**: Helpful for linking to social media profiles, personal websites, or other online presences related to the HNS identity.

### 8. SRV (Service) Record
- **Purpose**: Similar to DNS SRV records, defines the location (hostname and port) of specific services related to an HNS identity.
- **Example**: `_auth._tcp.stephen.hns SRV 0 5 443 auth.example.com`.
- **Use Cases**: Indicates where services like authentication, voice, or other user-centric services should be routed.

### 9. AUTH (Authentication) Record
- **Purpose**: Specifies the authentication methods available for verifying the user's identity. Could include methods such as OAuth, FIDO2, or WebAuthn.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns AUTH ["OAuth", "WebAuthn"]`.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for decentralized login services or to provide information about the supported authentication protocols for accessing services.

### 10. RL (Relationship) Record
- **Purpose**: Specifies relationships between HNS entities, such as connections to family members, friends, colleagues, or even devices.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns RL {"spouse": "kate.hns", "device": "stephen-phone.hns"}`.
- **Use Cases**: Helps build networks or graphs of relationships between people or objects within the HNS space, providing the basis for privacy-managed social networks.

### 11. SOC (Social Connections) Record
- **Purpose**: Contains information about social media handles or digital personas.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns SOC {"twitter": "@stephenw", "instagram": "@stepheninsta"}`.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for services that want to link directly to a person’s various public online presences.

### 12. VER (Verification) Record
- **Purpose**: Indicates whether the identity has been verified by certain methods or by a trusted authority.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns VER {"status": "verified", "authority": "ID.me"}`.
- **Use Cases**: Helps determine whether a given name is verified and can be trusted for more sensitive interactions.

### 13. DID (Decentralized Identifier) Record
- **Purpose**: Associates an HNS name with a Decentralized Identifier (DID) to link the HNS to other blockchain-based or decentralized identity systems.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns DID did:example:123456789abcdefghi`.
- **Use Cases**: Enables interoperability with other decentralized identity systems, allowing the use of a DID as an identifier.

### 14. Bio (Biometric Identifier) Record
- **Purpose**: Links a human-readable name to one or more biometric data types, such as facial recognition, fingerprints, or other forms of biometric identification.
- **Example**: `stephen.hns BIO {"identifierType": "fingerprint", "method": "Apple Touch ID", "biometricHash": "c2d6b3...hashedValue"}`.
- **Use Cases**: Provides a seamless and secure way to verify the identity through biometric data, useful for passwordless authentication and secure access.

## Establishing an HNS Entity Similar to ICANN

To establish an HNS entity similar to **ICANN** (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), you will need to create a centralized or partially decentralized authority that oversees the governance, registration, and dispute resolution processes for HNS. Below are the steps and structure for setting up an HNS management entity:

### 1. Create a Governing Body (HNS Authority)
- **HNS Authority**: Create a governing organization that would oversee the policies, standards, and governance for HNS, similar to ICANN. This could be a **non-profit organization** that ensures HNS remains transparent, accessible, and secure.
- **Board of Directors**: Form a board with representatives from different stakeholders, such as technology experts, government liaisons, privacy advocates, and industry leaders.

### 2. Establish an HNS Registry and Registrars
- **HNS Registry**: Create the official **HNS Registry**, which will be responsible for maintaining the authoritative database of all HNS records.
- **HNS Registrars**: Authorize multiple **registrars** that can register HNS names on behalf of users, similar to how domain registrars work under ICANN. These registrars would handle customer interactions, name registrations, renewals, and other administrative tasks.

### 3. Develop Policies and Procedures
- **Registration Policies**: Define policies for name registration, such as eligibility, naming conventions, and guidelines to avoid name collisions or conflicts.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Implement a process for **dispute resolution**, similar to the **UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy)** used by ICANN, to handle conflicts over HNS name ownership or misuse.
- **Verification Requirements**: Establish rules for identity verification, especially for sensitive or premium HNS names. Use records like **VER (Verification)** and **Bio (Biometric Identifier)** for enhanced trust.

### 4. Monetization and Funding
- **Registration Fees**: Charge fees for HNS name registration, renewal, and premium names. Similar to domain registration, users would pay a yearly fee to maintain their HNS name.
- **Premium Name Auctions**: Auction off high-value or commonly desired HNS names to generate revenue.
- **Partnerships**: Partner with **existing domain registrars** or technology companies to expand the reach of HNS and generate additional revenue streams.

### 5. Create an HNS Governance Framework
- **Community Involvement**: Develop a community-based governance framework where stakeholders can provide input on policies and standards. You could use a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** for voting on major changes.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Ensure transparency by publishing regular reports, maintaining public records, and allowing public comment periods for new policies.

### 6. Establish Technical Infrastructure
- **Root HNS Servers**: Set up **root HNS servers**, similar to DNS root servers, which will be responsible for ensuring that HNS queries are resolved properly and securely.
- **Distributed Ledger**: Consider using a **blockchain-based distributed ledger** to keep track of HNS registrations and changes. This would enhance security, reduce the risk of tampering, and ensure transparency.

### 7. Integrate Security and Privacy Measures
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that user data, such as P and Bio records, are stored securely, with appropriate encryption to protect privacy.
- **Security Standards**: Develop and enforce security standards for registrars and other entities that interact with the HNS infrastructure.
- **DNSSEC Equivalent**: Implement security extensions similar to **DNSSEC** to protect against spoofing and ensure integrity in the name resolution process.

## Summary
Establishing an HNS entity similar to ICANN would involve creating a governing body, an authoritative registry, and a network of registrars. It would require developing robust policies for registration, verification, and dispute resolution while ensuring transparency, privacy, and security. This entity would provide the oversight needed to make HNS a reliable and widely adopted system for mapping human-readable names to digital identities. Just as ICANN manages the DNS ecosystem, the HNS Authority would manage the Human Name System to ensure its scalability, trustworthiness, and accessibility.
